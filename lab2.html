<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="question-1-understand-your-audience">Question 1: Understand your audience</h2>
<p>rubric={completion:5}</p>
<p>In this lab, you will be tasked to writing a data science blog based on the topic you chose in lab 1.</p>
<p>As mentioned in Lecture 2, an audience persona is a brief written description of a specific person in your target audience, who might be real or imagined. It should include the following information about the person:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their <strong>experience</strong>. How much experience do they have with your subject, and of what kind?</li>
<li>Their <strong>motivation</strong>. Why do they want to learn about this subject? If they have any specific goals, what are they?</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here are three personas for potential audiences of an explanation of quantum computing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike is a third-grade student. He has fairly little experience with any computers at all, let alone quantum computers. But he suspects that computers might be able to help his with tough homework problems, and wants to know if this is true of quantum computers.</li>
<li>Nadine is a fifteen-year-old high school student. She is familiar with computers; most commonly she uses her iPhone to socialize, study, and take photoes. She has never heard of quantum computers before, but likes to impress her friends with cool facts about things she learns.</li>
<li>Alex is an undergraduate computer science student interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. They taken courses in chemistry and physics, and knows the basics of how quantum computing differs from classical computing. They are curious about the kinds of problems that quantum computing could be used to solve, and how soon the technology might become commercially available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Write an audience persona for the target reader of your blog that is <strong>3-5 sentences long</strong>. Additionally, propose a <strong>minimum of 3 different titles</strong> for your blog. During the lab, we encourage you to exchange the audience persona, the titles, and the abstract with your peers and get their initial feedback.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Proposed Blog Titles:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Moneyball for Manga: Can Data Predict the Next <em>Demon Slayer</em>?</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Digital Scout: Why Your Next Anime Hit is Hiding in the Data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Beyond Book Sales: How Sentiment Analysis is Revolutionizing Anime Greenlighting</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Audience Persona:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Target:</strong> Sarah, a Senior Acquisitions Manager at Crunchyroll(mid-sized streaming service).</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Sarah has over 10 years of experience in the entertainment industry and negotiates licensing deals for new anime series. However, she relies heavily on traditional metrics like manga sales volume and has no technical background in machine learning or data science. Her primary motivation is to <strong>reduce the financial risk of licensing flops</strong> and to identify underrated <strong>sleeper hits</strong> before her competitors do. She is looking for a competitive edge like a Moneyball approach to content acquisition, which can justify her decisions to the finance department with concrete evidence rather than just gut feeling.</p>

<p><em>By Nishanth Kumarasamy</em></p>
<section id="introduction-the-high-cost-of-a-missed-hit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-the-high-cost-of-a-missed-hit">Introduction: The High Cost of a Missed Hit</h3>
<p>Every year, the Japanese animation industry churns out hundreds of new series. For fans, it is a feast of content. For production studios and streaming services, it is a high-stakes casino. A single season of high-quality anime can cost millions of dollars to produce. If it becomes the next global phenomenon like Jujutsu Kaisen or Demon Slayer, the merchandise and licensing revenue is astronomical. But for every hit, there are dozens of shows that vanish into obscurity, failing to recover their production costs.</p>
<p>The industry has traditionally operated on a mix of executive intuition “gut feeling” and raw manga sales figures. The logic seems sound, if a manga sells millions of copies, the anime adaptation should have a built-in audience. But this correlation is becoming increasingly unreliable in the streaming era. We have all seen massive bestsellers result in lackluster anime adaptations that fail to capture viewership (eg. Tokyo Ghoul). Conversely, obscure cult favorites with mediocre sales have suddenly exploded into global dominance upon being animated (eg. Demon Slayer).</p>
<p>As a data scientist (and an anime fan), I began to wonder, Is there a hidden signal in the noise? Can we move beyond simple sales volume and use machine learning to identify the next big hit before a single frame of animation is drawn?</p>
</section>
<section id="the-problem-with-gut-feeling-and-raw-sales" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem-with-gut-feeling-and-raw-sales">The Problem with “Gut Feeling” and Raw Sales</h3>
<p>Traditionally, an acquisitions manager reads manga and decides, based on their experience, what will work on TV. While valuable, this method is inherently prone to personal bias. A producer might greenlight a series because they personally love the art style, ignoring data suggesting the genre is currently oversaturated in the market.</p>
<p>Furthermore, relying solely on manga sales volume is a flawed metric. Sales tell you how many people bought the first volume because of marketing hype or a cool cover. It does not necessarily tell you how they felt about it. Did they read it once and forget it? Or did they become obsessed, buying every subsequent volume and discussing it daily online? Sales data alone cannot distinguish between fleeting interest and deep engagement. But data science can.</p>
</section>
<section id="enter-the-digital-scout" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="enter-the-digital-scout">Enter the “Digital Scout”</h3>
<p>To solve this, we proposing building a Digital Scout, a predictive model that analyzes audience behavior rather than just point-of-sale transactions. By scraping publicly available data from massive aggregation sites like MyAnimeList, Reddit communities, and Twitter trends, we can look at the vital signs of a manga series long before it gets an anime announcement. The goal isn’t to replace the human element of curation, but to arm decision makers with a statistical flashlight in a dark room.</p>
<p>We analyzed historical data of manga that were adapted into anime over the last decade, comparing their pre-adaptation metrics against the eventual success of the anime. The visualization below reveals why relying on sales alone is dangerous.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="img/Sales_Vs_Success.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Fig:1 Manga Sales Vs Anime Success</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As Figure 1 demonstrates, high manga sales do not guarantee anime success. There is a distinct cluster of “Risk Traps”, manga that sell well initially due to hype but have dismal retention rates. Adapting these properties often leads to significant viewership drop off mid-season.</p>
<p>Conversely, the model identifies “Sleeper Hits”. These properties have lower total sales volume, making them cheaper to license, but they boast incredible retention rates. These are the properties that create devoted, evangelizing fanbases that drive viral word of mouth growth, the holy grail for streaming platforms looking to reduce subscriber churn.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-three-key-metrics-of-success" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-three-key-metrics-of-success">The Three Key Metrics of Success</h3>
<p>Through our analysis, we identified three specific behavioral metrics that correlate more strongly with eventual anime success than raw sales ever did.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="img/Iceberg.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Fig:2 Manga Sales Vs Anime Success Vs Engagement Metrics</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p><strong>1. The Stickiness Factor (Reader Retention)</strong> Volume 1 sales measure marketing success but Volume 10 sales measure loyalty. “Retention Rate” is the percentage of readers who start a series and stick with it through later arcs.</p>
<p>However, not all retention is created equal. Our analysis revealed that certain niche genres command much higher loyalty than mainstream ones.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="img/visualization.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Fig:3 Retention Rate across Genre</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As shown in Figure 3, widely popular genres like Isekai (fantasy portal) are oversaturated. While they might sell many initial copies, readers quickly move on to the next similar title. In contrast, genres like Psychological Thrillers may have smaller total audiences, but nearly every reader finishes the series. For a subscription service, a smaller, intensely loyal audience is often safer than a large, fickle one.</p>
<p><strong>2. Sentiment Analysis: Obsession vs.&nbsp;Approval</strong> Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze thousands of user reviews, we can distinguish between mild approval and fanatic obsession. A series rated 8/10 because it was a pleasant read is very different from a series rated 8/10 because it was emotionally devastating. Our data shows that high-arousal emotion words, even negative ones like “heartbreak” or “frustrated” which are better predictors of engagement than generic praise. Polarizing content often outperforms safe content in the streaming era because it drives conversation.</p>
<p><strong>3. Community Velocity</strong> How fast does news travel? “Community Velocity” measures the speed of discussion threads following a new chapter release. If a manga chapter drops and forums explode with 5,000 comments in an hour, the velocity is high, indicating viral potential. High-velocity properties are prime candidates for adaptation because the fanbase will do the marketing for you on social media.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-risk-score-system-and-technical-reality" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-risk-score-system-and-technical-reality">The Risk Score System and Technical Reality</h3>
<p>We don’t just hand producers raw data. We feed these metrics into a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest Classifier to generate a simple “Risk Score” for unadapted manga.</p>
<p>We chose a Random Forest approach over simpler models like Logistic Regression because the relationship between these metrics is rarely linear. For example, high negative sentiment might kill a romance series, but it might actually propel a dark thriller to viral status. The Random Forest model can learn these complex, genre-specific nuances.</p>
<p>However, no model is magic. Analyzing our “False Positives” cases where the model predicted a hit, but the anime flopped have taught us a crucial lesson, that execution matters. The model can identify a winning script (the manga), but it cannot predict if a studio will rush the animation production or cut the budget. The data validates the IP’s potential, but the final product’s quality remains a human variable.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion-smarter-greenlighting" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-smarter-greenlighting">Conclusion: Smarter Greenlighting</h3>
<p>In an industry where one failure can bankrupt a smaller studio, using data to filter projects is no longer a luxury rather it is a necessity.</p>
<p>By listening to behavioral data rather than just sales figures, studios can move away from chasing expensive, over-hyped properties that may already have peaked. The “Digital Scout” allows them to take calculated risks on unique, high-retention stories that are currently undervalued by the market. The next global anime phenomenon is out there, sitting quietly on a bookshelf. We just need to use the right lens to find it.</p>
